The winning submission to the Barracuda 2011 Michigan contest.  To run just do

make
./server ./dumb 4776

And the game RPC server will be started on port 4776.  dumb is in fact the final
bot and remains with the name 'dumb' for legacy reasions :).  dump.cpp:valuate()
is where all the magic happens.  You can play bots together without using RPC
using player like

./player ./dumb ./dumb

Just implement the protocol to the pipes passed on the command line as you can
see done by dumb.
